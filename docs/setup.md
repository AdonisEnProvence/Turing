## Dockerfile

Follow those steps to launch a local Docker container with Erlang installed.

```sh
# Build an image defined in the `Dockerfile` of `.` directory and name it `turing`.

docker build -f Dockerfile.local -t turing .

# Run the image named `turing`, attach local directory to /turing directory in the container, thanks to volumes.
# If we change files on our computer, the changes will be reflected in the container.
# Run the container in detached mode so that we can access the container with a shell when we want.
docker run -d --name turing -v $PWD:/turing -p 8080:8080 turing

# Launch a shell inside the container.
# We will write the same commands as if we were developing directly on our machine.
docker exec -it turing bash

# Remove container
docker rm -f turing
```

## Bats shell tests

To run shell tests you have to be inside the docker container
